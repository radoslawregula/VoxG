VoxG: Singing voice synthesizer using GAN.
==============================
This repository contains implementation of a Wasserstein-GAN for singing voice synthesis in Tensorflow 2.5. The neural networks were trained using publicly available [NUS-48E sung and spoken lyrics corpus](https://www.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05-Pub-NUS-48E.pdf). 

The code is based on an original implementation described in [WGANSing: A Multi-Voice Singing Voice Synthesizer Based on the Wasserstein-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10729.pdf), however with improvements regarding the training process and code quality. The implementation of WGAN can be reused for other similar tasks.

This project was completed as a Master's thesis in Computer Science, Adam Mickiewicz University, Pozna≈Ñ, Poland.
